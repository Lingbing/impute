Missing values imputation based on automated variable selection

-----
This R package provides a general framework for missing values imputation based on automated variable selection. It was orignated from part of my PhD thesis and was extended as an R package. The main function `impute` inputs a matrix containing missing values and returns a complete data matrix using the variable selection functions provided as part of the package, or written by the users.
